'''Problem: Sorting a list in ascending order with only right shift
Algorithm: Hill Climbing (Steepest ascent)

#Initialize():
	initialize a list -> [7, 1, 9, 0, 5, 8, 4, 2, 10, 0, 20] and return it

#calculate_cost(state):
Counting Inversion Problem
for each element of the list:
look forward in the list and see how many elements are smaller than this element i.e. how many are in wrong order	
Add up the number of disorders and return
	
#State_generation(current_state):
	while True:
current_state_cost = calculate_cost(current_state)
print(current_state, current_state_cost )
min_next_cost = INF
min_next_state = None
for each element in the list:
swap with the forward elements of the list with this element one by one and generate one state for each swap using a for loop.
	next_state = newly generated state by shifting the element right n times
next_state_cost = calculate_cost(next_state)

if next_state_cost is smaller than min_next_cost:
min_next_cost = next_state_cost
min_next_state = next_state 

# take that state which has the smallest cost
if min_next_cost is smaller than current_state_cost:
	current_state = min_next_state
else :
	print(“Final State:”, current_state, current_state_cost )
break
